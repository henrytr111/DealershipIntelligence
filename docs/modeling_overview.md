# Modeling overview

## Models
1) Forecasting model (units/revenue)
2) Expected sale price model (pricing sanity check) + anomaly flags

## Evaluation
- Baselines for forecasting
- Time-series backtesting
- Error metrics (MAE/MAPE) and segment checks

## Notes
- Avoid leakage (time-aware splits)
- Treat Customer Name as PII (exclude)
